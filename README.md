# Introduction

This repository contains notebooks that demonstrate the utilization of open-source codes for the study of materials science. 

Over the course of my work, I frequently get requests (from students, postdocs, collaborators, or just general users) for example codes that demonstrate various capabilities in the open-source software I maintain and contribute to, such as the Materials Project software stack comprising Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) (http://www.pymatgen.org), Custodian, and Fireworks. I have began to realize that writing customized code snippets is not an efficient use of my time. 

This repo is a start at building a more sustainable path towards sharing of code examples. 

It is not limited to the codes I develop - any use of open source software for materials analysis is welcome.

Contributors are not limited to myself - anyone is welcome to contribute. Just fork, write and submit pull request.

# A few ground rules

1. Notebooks should be fairly well-documented and simple. The idea here is to be pedagogical. A newcomer to the software (with the right materials science technical background) should be able to follow the logic without too much difficulty.

2. Notebooks should be placed in the appropriate year folder, and the name should start with the date of the notebook in YYYYMMDD format. See existing examples.

3. Feel free to add authorship and contact information, as well as works to cite and acknowledge your contributions.
