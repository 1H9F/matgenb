# Introduction

This repository contains notebooks that demonstrate the utilization of open-source codes for the study of materials science. 

Over the course of my work, I frequently get requests (from students, postdocs, collaborators, or just general users) for example codes that demonstrate various capabilities in the open-source software I maintain and contribute to, such as the Materials Project software stack comprising Python Materials Genomics (pymatgen) (http://www.pymatgen.org), Custodian, and Fireworks. I have began to realize that writing customized code snippets is not an efficient use of my time. 

This repo is a start at building a more sustainable path towards sharing of code examples. 

It is not limited to the codes I develop - any use of open source software for materials analysis is welcome.

Contributors are not limited to myself - anyone is welcome to contribute. Just fork, write and submit pull request.
